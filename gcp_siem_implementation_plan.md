    *   Create Cloud Storage buckets in the Indonesia region to archive raw logs for long-term retention.
    *   Implement a lifecycle policy to move logs to different storage classes based on access frequency (e.g., Standard, Nearline, Coldline).
    *   Implement encryption key management for BigQuery datasets and Cloud Storage buckets to meet data residency requirements.
*   **Timeline:** 1 week
*   **Potential Challenges:**
    *   Managing encryption keys securely.
    *   Optimizing BigQuery partitioning and clustering for different query patterns.

**III. Data Processing:**

*   **Goal:** Process and transform ingested data to prepare it for analysis.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Develop Dataflow pipelines in the Indonesia region to enrich, normalize, and aggregate log data and events.
    *   Implement Cloud Functions in the Indonesia region to perform threat intelligence lookups and other data processing tasks.
*   **Timeline:** 2 weeks
*   **Potential Challenges:**
    *   Developing complex Dataflow pipelines.
    *   Ensuring that data processing logic is accurate and efficient.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use a modular approach to develop Dataflow pipelines.
    *   Thoroughly test data processing logic.

**IV. Threat Detection:**

*   **Goal:** Detect and prioritize security risks using various threat detection techniques.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Leverage Security Command Center to identify and prioritize security risks in the Google Cloud environment.
    *   Ingest and analyze security telemetry using Chronicle's threat detection capabilities (if available in the Indonesia region).
    *   Deploy pre-existing AI/ML models in Vertex AI to detect anomalous behavior and potential threats.
*   **Timeline:** 2 weeks
*   **Potential Challenges:**
    *   Integrating with Chronicle (if available).
    *   Tuning AI/ML models to minimize false positives and false negatives.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Work with Google Cloud support to enable Chronicle in the Indonesia region.
    *   Continuously monitor and refine AI/ML models.

**V. Visualization and Reporting:**

*   **Goal:** Visualize security data and generate reports using Looker dashboards.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Connect Looker to BigQuery in the Indonesia region.
    *   Develop Looker dashboards to visualize key security metrics and trends.
    *   Generate reports on security incidents and vulnerabilities.
*   **Timeline:** 1 week
*   **Potential Challenges:**
    *   Designing effective Looker dashboards.
    *   Ensuring that reports are accurate and informative.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Work with security analysts to design Looker dashboards.
    *   Validate reports against raw data.

**VI. Integration:**

*   **Goal:** Integrate the SIEM with other security tools and threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Develop a Cloud Function or Dataflow pipeline to simulate integration with CrowdStrike EDR. This mockup will receive alerts from the SIEM and trigger simulated responses.
    *   Integrate with threat intelligence feeds by periodically fetching data and storing it in BigQuery for enrichment and correlation.
*   **Timeline:** 1 week
*   **Potential Challenges:**
    *   Simulating realistic CrowdStrike EDR responses.
    *   Ensuring that threat intelligence feeds are reliable and up-to-date.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Work with security experts to design realistic CrowdStrike EDR responses.
    *   Use reputable threat intelligence feeds.

**VII. Security Best Practices:**

*   **Goal:** Implement security best practices to protect the SIEM infrastructure and data.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement IAM roles and policies to restrict access to Google Cloud resources based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Enable encryption at rest for BigQuery datasets and Cloud Storage buckets.
    *   Use HTTPS for all data in transit.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   **Timeline:** Ongoing
*   **Potential Challenges:**
    *   Maintaining a strong security posture over time.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Establish a security governance program.
    *   Automate security monitoring and alerting.

**VIII. Cost Optimization:**

*   **Goal:** Optimize the cost of the SIEM infrastructure.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Use appropriate storage tiers in Cloud Storage based on access frequency.
    *   Optimize Dataflow pipelines to minimize processing time and resource consumption.
    *   Leverage serverless computing with Cloud Functions and Dataflow to avoid paying for idle resources.
    *   Use partitioning and clustering in BigQuery to optimize query performance and storage costs.
*   **Timeline:** Ongoing
*   **Potential Challenges:**
    *   Balancing cost optimization with performance and security.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Continuously monitor resource utilization and costs.
    *   Adjust resource allocation as needed.

**IX. Data Residency:**

*   **Goal:** Ensure that all data is stored and processed within the Indonesia region to comply with data residency requirements.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Verify that all Google Cloud resources are located in the Indonesia region.
    *   Implement encryption key management to ensure that encryption keys are also stored in the Indonesia region.
    *   Implement access control policies to restrict access to data based on location.
